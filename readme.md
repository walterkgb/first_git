Let's start using markdown
==========================

Hi everyone, I am learning to use markdown, writting it directly from the terminal with the GNU nano.

## Why markdown?

It makes sense to use this *formatting syntax* since it can be read in raw mode. If processed, things will look nicer, but you can always read them.

## Testing some formats

We can `Inline code` with backticks.

```
A code block needs 3 backticks at the beginning and at the end.
4 indent spaces in all the content should do the work too.
```

> Blockquotes just need a "bigger than" symbol.
