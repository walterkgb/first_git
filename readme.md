Let's start using markdown
==========================

Hi everyone, I am learning to use markdown, writting it directly from the terminal with the GNU nano.

## Why markdown?

It makes sense to use this *formatting syntax* since it can be read in raw mode. If processed, things will look nicer, but you can always read them.

## Testing some formats

We can `Inline code` with backticks.

```
A code block needs 3 backticks at the beginning and at the end.
4 indent spaces in all the content should do the work too.
```

> Blockquotes just need a "bigger than" symbol.

[This is a neat cheatsheet with the most common styles](https://commonmark.org/help/)

[The GitHub flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/) is an amazing document, an example on how to write a specification.

I couldn't resist to add the [Emoji-cheat-sheat](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md) to this page :sweat_smile:

The [basic writting and formatting syntax] guide on GitHub is also a great document to remember most frenquently used markdown syntax.

This is the cheatsheet that CodeAcadamy links at the end of the markdown course: [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is a nice cheatsheet published in GitHub. The kind of document you can create to learn everything about markdown.
