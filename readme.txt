Hi Gitbhub

This is today's milestone. If you do more, that is great, but if not, this was enough.

Today, 16 of december, if I don't do more is because a friend asked me to help him taming a dragon... I can't let him down. 

I am going to edit this file directly on GitHub on the 17th of december. Now I am going to save it and see what happens when I fetch locally.
